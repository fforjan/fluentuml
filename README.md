# Fluent Uml ?
What is UML ? For me, it is a way to describe the architecture of your software. 
It gives basic diagram type.
Yeah, you can be a purist and do UML in the pure way, but for me, I use it only as everyone knows how to read it.
Same as a map, it gives you direction.

Why UML compare to simply exploring code ? 
I always find more interesting to have partial maps of my code with only specic area of interest and/or dedicated purpose and share this to others.
A beginner would/should be interested in those high level maps before jumping into the code.
A expert in that area shoudl not need it.

But if you modify the map... it should break something !
Usual UML document are out of sync unless you have a strict handling of those documents in your team.

Thus this simply idea of creating code maps via UML concept using your code and ensuring that a key change should trigger a review/break change !
